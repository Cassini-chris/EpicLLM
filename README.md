# EpicLLM
## LLM Endeavor
This repository serves as a platform for testing, evaluating, and exploring the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We aim to delve into the fundamental aspects of these powerful models, understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and potential applications.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this endeavor are:

-Benchmarking LLM Performance: We will compare and contrast the performance of various LLM architectures across a range of tasks, including text generation, translation, question answering, and code summarization.

-Evaluating LLM Biases: We will investigate the inherent biases and biases introduced by training data in LLMs. This includes identifying potential biases in factual outputs and understanding their impact on downstream applications.

-Exploring LLM Applications: We will explore the diverse applications of LLMs, venturing into areas like creative writing, natural language understanding, and code generation.
